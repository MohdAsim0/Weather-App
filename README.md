# Weather-App
This weather app project  will empower users to access weather information for any city.
The process will involve the user inputting the city name into an input field and clicking a button or pressing enter to retrieve the weather data.
By Using JavaScript, I have connected to an open weather API to access relevant weather data for the specified city. 
To represent weather conditions, I used icons or images like a sun or a cloud. 
In handling errors while fetching data from the weather API, I have used  the 'try and catch' technique.
